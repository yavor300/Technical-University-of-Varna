# Decorator Pattern

## Definition

It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
## Concept

An alternative to inheritance is composition. It is quite common in programming and often gives you a better payoff. This chapter shows a useful case study on this topic using some wrappers.

So, what is a wrapper(or a decorator)? A wrapper is like a topping that surrounds an object. The enclosing object is often called a decorator, which conforms to the interface of the component that it decorates. In programming, you often use a wrapper to add functionalities dynamically. This is a powerful technique because you can add or discard a wrapper as per your need, and it does not hamper the functionalities of the original object.
This pattern is most effective when you add decorators dynamically. Itâ€™s interesting to note since decorators are often added dynamically, it is perfectly fine if you do not want them in a later phase of development, because the original object can still work for you.
