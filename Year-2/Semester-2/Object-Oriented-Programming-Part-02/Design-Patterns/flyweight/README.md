# Flyweight Pattern

## Definition

It uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

## Concept

Sometimes you need to handle lots of objects that are very similar (but not the same). But the constraint is that you cannot create all of them to lessen resource and memory usage. The Flyweight pattern is made to handle these scenarios.
